## Tech Assessment: Todo App

*Objective*: Create a full-stack todo application that allows users to manage tasks across multiple categories. The
application should have a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js, and a frontend interface built with React.js andRedux Toolkit. Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend development.


### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new todo item with a title, description, and due date.
- As a user, I want to assign a category to each todo item.
- As a user, I want to view all my todo items grouped by their categories.
- As a user, I want to mark a todo item as complete or incomplete.
- As a user, I want to edit the details of an existing todo item.
- As a user, I want to delete a todo item.
- As a user, I want to create new categories for organizing my todo items.
- As a user, I want to filter todo items by their completion status (all, active, completed).
- As a user, I want to sort todo items by due date or creation date.


### Technical Requirements - Backend

- Backend (Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript):
- Set up a Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on todo items and categories.
- You can use an in memory db for the purposes of this app or tie into a tranditional db.
- Implement proper error handling and input validation.


### Server Requirements - Frontend

- Frontend (React.js, Redux w/ redux-toolkit, TypeScript):
- Set up a React project with TypeScript using vite
- Create components for displaying todo items, categories, and forms for adding/editing items.
- Implement Redux store and slices for managing application state.
- Submission Guidelines:
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.


# Evaluation Criteria:

- Code quality, organization, and adherence to TypeScript best practices.
- Proper implementation of Redux Toolkit for state management.
- RESTful API design and implementation.
- User interface design and responsiveness.
- Error handling and input validation.
- Bonus points for additional features or optimizations.

## Makeen – Tech Assessment: Todo App

This is a full-stack Todo application built as a technical assessment.
Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript (initialized with Vite)
Uses an in-memory data store

### Requirements
Node.js (v18+ recommended)
npm

**Running the Backend**:
cd server
npm install
npm run dev


The Express API will start on:

http://localhost:8080

**Running the Frontend**
cd client
npm install
npm run dev


The React app will start on:

http://localhost:5173

### Notes

The frontend communicates directly with the backend via REST APIs.
Application state is managed using Redux Toolkit.
Todos can be created, edited, deleted, completed, filtered, sorted, and grouped by category.
Categories can be created and assigned to todos.
All data is stored in memory for simplicity.
